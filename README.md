<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
A Discord and Second Life bot capable of relaying messages between inworld Second Life Groups, and Discord Channels, supports (theoretically) as many groups as second life allows(42 for normal accounts, 70 for premium, 140 for premium plus). This has **NOT** been tested with more than 10 groups, your available memory(ram) is also a limitation.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* The Latest NPM:

  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

*  Node:
    * Refer to [Installing Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) 
    *  If you are confused [Installing Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) is a good place to start. 
*  A Discord Bot Token:
    * Refer to [This Guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot) if you are not sure how to do this.
* Discord Channel ID:
    * This is a good [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLWtSHWKbAI)
* Second Life Group UUID:
    * [This](https://community.secondlife.com/forums/topic/358216-how-doi-find-a-group-uuid-key/) SL Forums explains how
    * In world the bot must be in the groups you want it to relay.
* Add your bot to a discord server using this link(add your CLIENT ID from your bot where specified)
    * https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=140123819008
    * This gives the bot the following permissions: View Channels, Manage Webhooks, Send Messages, Embed Links, Attach Files, Use External Stickers and Emojis, Mention All Roles, Use Application Commands and Read Message History.
    * **If the server requires 2 Factor Authentication(2FA), the bot owner must also have 2FA enable.**
    * Visit this [link](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028717192-Where-can-I-find-my-Application-Team-Server-ID) to find out how to get your CLIENT ID. 
    * Discord may refer to **Client ID** as **Application ID**, its the same thing.
* Add your Second Life Bot account(**NOT YOUR ACCOUNT, THE BOTS!**) to all the groups you want to relay. Make sure it has Join Chat enabled!

## Installation

1. Clone the repo and open the repository folder:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/redrobotsl/discord-sl-chat-relay.git && cd discord-sl-chat-relay
   ```
   
2. Run npm install in the folder:
   ```sh
   npm install --no-dev
   ```
   
3. Copy the `.env-example` to `.env`:
    ```sh
    cp .env-example .env
    ```
    
4. Copy `config.js.example` to `config.js`:
    ```sh 
    cp config.js.example .config.js
     ```
     
5. Fill out `.env` with the required environment variables:
   ```env
   DISCORD_TOKEN= 
   OWNER= 
   SL_FIRSTNAME= 
   SL_LASTNAME= 
   SL_PASSWORD= 
   SL_START=
   ```
   
6. Edit `config.js` to map the inworld group UUIDS to the Discord Channel IDS:
   ```js
    relays: new Map([
     ["SL GROUP UUID", "DISCORD CHANNEL ID"] // For just one group no comma after the bracket
    ]),
   ```
   For Multiple:
 
    ```js
	relays: new Map([
	 ["SL Group UUID", "Discord Channel ID"], // For Multiple relays you need a comma after each bracket but the last one
	 ["SL Group UUID", "Discord Channel ID"], // For Multiple relays you need a comma after each bracket but the last one
	 ["SL Group UUID", "Discord Channel ID"], // For Multiple relays you need a comma after each bracket but the last one
	 ["SL Group UUID", "Discord Channel ID"], // For Multiple relays you need a comma after each bracket but the last one
	 ["SL Group UUID", "Discord Channel ID"], // For Multiple relays you need a comma after each bracket but the last one
	 ["SL Group UUID", "Discord Channel ID"] //  No Comma After the final bracket.
	 ]),
   ```

7. Start the bot using:
 
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```
   
8. Invite the bot to your server:  
    * [Here](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html#bot-invite-links) is how to do it
    * Its just the url you built in the [prerequisites](https://github.com/redrobotsl/discord-sl-chat-relay?tab=readme-ov-file#prerequisites) steps

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add Region Restart Evasion with Fallback Regions in the Config File
	* On Region Restart notice, teleport to a fallback region, as well as on login, if can't login to the main region, teleport to a fallback region, don't want your bots sticking around somewhere you don't want it
- [ ] Add Reload Capability of SL and Discord Commands/Event files.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/redrobotsl/discord-sl-chat-relay/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
